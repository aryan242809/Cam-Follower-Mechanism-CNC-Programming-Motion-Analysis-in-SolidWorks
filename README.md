# Cam-Follower-Mechanism-CNC-Programming-Motion-Analysis-in-SolidWorks
This repository contains simulation and analysis files for a cam-follower system designed and analyzed in SolidWorks Motion. It includes assembly creation, material assignment, and advanced motion simulations with and without spring loading. Additionally, the project includes a CNC programming task using G-code.

📄 Assignment Overview
🔧 Part 1: Cam-Follower Motion Analysis
🧩 Assembly Setup:
Distance between the cam center and block: 5 inches

Materials:
Cam: ASTM A36 Steel
Follower: Aluminium 1060 Alloy
Block: AISI 1020 Steel

⚙️ Motion Simulation:
Motor input: 120 RPM (clockwise)
Simulations:
Without spring
With a 50 lbf/inch spring between block and follower

Recorded outputs:
Velocity, Acceleration, Displacement of follower top point
Simulation screenshots

📊 Result Comparison:
Effect of spring on motion smoothness, stress distribution, and performance prediction
Enhanced realism and dynamic behavior when including spring force

🧾 Part 2: CNC Programming – G-code
G-code setup for a toolpath moving through defined points in incremental (G91) mode
Spindle control, tool selection, coolant control, and Z-axis positioning

🏭 Part 3: Group Technology (GT) using Rank-Order Clustering
Reordering binary part-machine matrix based on decimal equivalents
Identifying part families and machine groups
Improves setup efficiency and reduces production time
